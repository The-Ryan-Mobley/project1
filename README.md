This is an app that’s perfect for the hobbyist astronomer. Simply click on the map where you plan on stargazing to see both the nightly weather and star map. This was our first team project I was the project leader so I spent most of the project linking everyone’s code together; I also worked on the weather api functions, and css styling.
